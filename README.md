# Description
We are developing a education resource platform that allows for students and teachers to share useful information via uploading data. Student users should be able to create an account that indicates their major, interest, clubs, and contact information. Student users should then be able to lookup profile, class, and resource information from established teacher users. Teacher users should be able to create an account that allows them to add their faculty information, list their classes, and adds useful information to their class descriptions. 

This application is intended to allow students to have easy access to faculty and school resource information while providing easy dispersion of information for faculty as well. Additionally, functions will be designed for an administrative user such as the ability to remove or add other users, functions to edit user information, etc. The application is cool because it will help condense a ton of useful school data and resources into a neat and easy to use application for both students and faculty.
